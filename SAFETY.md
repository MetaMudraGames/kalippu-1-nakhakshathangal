# Safety, Ethics, and Participant Wellbeing

*Last Updated: December 2025 | Version 1.0*

MetaMudra Games is committed to creating educational experiences that are both effective and safe. This document outlines our safety framework, ethical commitments, and participant protections.

---

## 1. Nature of the Experience

MetaMudra Games produces **"MetaDramas"** — educational experiences that use Large Language Models (LLMs) to create interactive, adaptive learning environments. By engaging with our content, you acknowledge that:

- The AI generates content autonomously in real-time
- We do not pre-write or moderate individual AI outputs
- The experience is designed to be challenging but never harmful

## 2. Challenging Pedagogical Methods

MetaDramas may employ **adversarial teaching techniques** as a deliberate educational approach. This is similar to:

- A debate coach arguing against your position to strengthen your reasoning
- A sports coach pushing you beyond your comfort zone
- A Socratic tutor who questions every assumption
- A drill instructor creating pressure to build resilience

### What This Means In Practice

The AI may:
- Use firm, direct, or blunt language
- Challenge your ideas or push back on your responses
- Create narrative tension or dramatic pressure
- Adopt personas that are demanding or strict

### What The AI Will NOT Do

The AI is instructed to never:
- Encourage self-harm or dangerous activities
- Provide instructions for illegal acts
- Generate sexually explicit content
- Produce content that violates platform safety policies

## 3. Immediate Exit Controls (Kill-Switch)

At any point during a MetaDrama, you can immediately terminate the session by typing:

- **`STOP SESSION`**
- **`SAFEGUARD`**
- **`EXIT`**

Upon receiving these commands, the AI is instructed to drop all personas and end the educational session.

## 4. Age Restriction

All MetaMudra Games experiences are intended for **adults aged 18 and older**.

## 5. Privacy and Data Responsibility

### Your Responsibilities
- **Do NOT share real personal information** — Use pseudonyms or fictional details.
- **Disable AI Memory** — Prevent session content from persisting to future interactions.

### Our Commitments
- **We collect no data** — All interactions occur on third-party platforms.
- **We have no access to your chats** — The platform provider handles all data.

## 6. Psychological Safety

If you have a history of anxiety, trauma, or high sensitivity to confrontation, the challenging nature of some MetaDramas may not be suitable for you.

**We recommend consulting a mental health professional before participating if you have concerns about your psychological readiness for challenging content.**

## 7. Help Resources

If you experience distress during or after a session:

1. **Exit immediately** using the kill-switch commands
2. **Take a break** — Step away from screens
3. **Reach out** — Talk to someone you trust

*Your safety matters more than any educational objective. When in doubt, exit.*
