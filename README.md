# KALIPPU

*When you argue with the past, the silence answers.*

## What Is This?
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════
KALIPPU is a series of interactive MetaDramasthat run inside Large Language Models.

You face ancient grudges. Ten breaths.
One chance to rewrite a centuries-old verdict.

║   Episode 1: Face a Sorcerer and a Yakshi.

║   Episode 2: (Coming Soon)

║

║   These games teach empathy through pressure.

║   The lesson is in the listening.

║   The Manthravadi is always watching.

## The Story

The forest was not on any map. A *Tharavadu* (ancestral home) lost in time, where the walls breathe and the roots bleed.

**474 years ago**, a woman was nailed to a Pala tree.
She has been waiting.
The **Manthravadi** (Sorcerer) who trapped her has been waiting too.

You are a traveler who found the wrong path. You touched the carving of the lion. You broke the seal.

Now you stand in the courtyard.
The Yakshi holds you by the throat.
The Manthravadi judges your answers.
You have **10 Breaths** (Shwasam).

If you fail, you join the collection.
If you succeed, you free the history.

## Episode 01: NAKHAKSHATHANGAL

*Status: Released*

The Yakshi, **Swaathantra**, does not want your fear. She has tasted fear for four centuries. She wants to know if humanity has changed. She asks questions about gender, power, and justice.

The Manthravadi mocks your modern answers. He believes humans are the same beasts they were in 1550.

You must prove him wrong.


```

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│   THE CHALLENGE:

│

│   ▪ The Yakshi asks the questions

│   ▪ The Manthravadi judges the answers

│   ▪ Platitudes will cost you Breath (-1 Shwasam)

│   ▪ Authenticity buys you Trust (+Vishwasam)

│   ▪ You must dismantle a 400-year-old curse
