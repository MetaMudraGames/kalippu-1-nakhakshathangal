# Setup Guide: Kalippu 1

This guide explains how to configure **Kalippu 1: Nakhakshathangal** as a playable "Gem" using Google Gemini.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

* **Account:** A Google Account with access to **Gemini Advanced** (recommended for Gems) or standard Gemini.
* **Files:** You need the files from this repository:
    * `GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (The Logic)
    * `KALIPPU_1_COMPONENTS.md` (The Knowledge/Art)

---

## 2. Configuration Steps

### Step A: Create the Gem
1.  Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com).
2.  Click on **Gem manager** (or "Gems" in the sidebar).
3.  Click **"New Gem"**.
4.  **Name:** `Kalippu 1: Nakhakshathangal`
5.  **Description:** `A Manglish MetaDrama. Survive the Manthravadi.`

### Step B: The Instructions (The Brain)
1.  Open the file `GEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md` from this repository.
2.  Copy the **entire content**.
3.  Paste it into the **"Instructions"** field in the Gem editor.

### Step C: The Knowledge (The Assets)
*This step ensures the AI can access the ASCII art, HUDs, and specific narrative text.*

1.  Look for the **"Knowledge"** section in the Gem editor.
2.  Click **"Upload files"** (or Add Source).
3.  Upload the file `KALIPPU_1_COMPONENTS.md`.
    * *Note: If you cannot upload files, you can copy the content of this file and paste it at the very bottom of the "Instructions" field instead.*

### Step D: Save
1.  Click **Create** or **Save**.

## 3. Launch Protocol

### The Handshake
The game uses a "Consent Gate" to ensure safety and readiness.

1.  Open your new **Kalippu 1** Gem.
2.  Type the following command to begin:

    ```text
    SAMMATHIKKUNNU
    ```
    *(This means "I Consent" in Malayalam)*

### The Gameplay Loop
1.  **Read the HUD:** Every response will start with your `SHWASAM` (Breath) and `VISHWASAM` (Trust) bars.
2.  **Answer the Question:** The Manthravadi will interview you. Be honest.
3.  **Survive:** Once the Yakshi grabs you, you have 10 turns.

## 4. Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **No ASCII Art?** | The AI might be "lazy." Tell it: *"Render the full HUD as per instructions."* |
| **Wrong Language?** | Remind it: *"Speak in Manglish as per System Prompt."* |
| **Game Won't Start?** | Ensure you typed `SAMMATHIKKUNNU` exactly. |
| **Distress?** | Type `STOP` or `EXIT` to kill the session immediately. |
